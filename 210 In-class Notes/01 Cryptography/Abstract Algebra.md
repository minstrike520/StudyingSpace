# Group
## Notation
- Positive number $\mathbb{P}:=\{ 1,2,3,\dots \}$
- Natural number $\mathbb{N}:=\{ 0,1,2,\dots \}$
- Integer $\mathbb{Z}:=\{ \dots,-2,-1,0,1,2\dots \}$
- $\mathbb{Z}_{n}:=\{ k\in\mathbb{N}|k<n \}$
- ${\mathbb{Z}_{n}}^{*}:=\{ k\in\mathbb{N}|\text{gcd}(k, n) = 1 \}$
- $\mathbb Q, \mathbb R, \mathbb C: \mathbb Q - \{ 0 \}, \mathbb{R} - \{ 0 \}, \mathbb{C} - \{ 0 \}$
## Defninition of Group
A group with a set $G$ and an operation $*$ need to satisfy all four traits below:
1. **Closure**: $a * b$ is in $G$ for any elements $a$ and $b$ in $G$.
2. **Associativity**: The equation $a*(b*c)=(a*b)*c$ satisfies for any elements $a$, $b$ and $c$ in $G$.
3. **Identity**: There exists an identity element $e$ such that $a=a*e=e*a$ for any element $a$ in $G$.
4. **Inverse**: There exists an inverse element $a^{-1}$ such that $a * a^{-1}=a^{-1}*a=e$.

## Bijective Function
A bijective function, or bijection, has to be both injection and surjection.
Injection (aka one-to-one function) means that the function 
> maps distinct elements of its domain to distinct elements of its codomain,

or described in symbols, $$
x_{1}\ne x_{2} \implies f(x_{1}) \ne f(x_{2}).
$$
Surjection (aka onto function) means that "for every element $y$ of the function's codomain, there exists **at least** one element $x$ in the function's domain such that $f(x)=y$".
We call a bijection signs "one-to one **correspondence**".

## Symmetric Group
A symmetric group is the set of all permutations on $\{ 1,2,\dots,n \}$ with operation $\circ$ .
Ex. Composition demonstration:
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
3  & 2 & 1
\end{pmatrix} \circ \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
2 & 3 & 1
\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
1 & 3 & 2
\end{pmatrix}
$$
Note: $1\to 3 \to 1$; $2 \to 2 \to 3$; $3 \to 1 \to 2$.

## Abelian / Non-Abelian Group
Commutativity
$$
a*b = b*a
$$
for all $a,b \in G$.
# Ring
## Ideal
A subset $I$ of a ring $R$ is an ideal if:
1. $I$ is an **additive group**;
2. $a*r\in I$ satisfies with every $a \in I$ and every $r \in R$.

Examples of ideals (for ring $R$)
1. $\{ 0 \}$ and $R$ itself
2. $aR:=\{ a*r|r\in R \}$ with any $a \in R$ (so-called **principal ideal**)
## Principal Ideal
The ideal ${<a> := aR = \{ a* R | r \in R \}}$ of a ring $R$ is a principal ideal generated by $a \in R$.

Examples of principal ideals
1. For ring $R$: ${<1> = R}$
2. Every ideal in $\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}[x]\dots$ is a principal ideal because every subset $I$ of them can be described as ${I = }$

## Congruent Class
For $I$ and $R$, if ${a - b \in I}$ with ${a, b \in R}$, we say that $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $I$. 
Before we only do "modulo" with an element $m$ such that ${ a- b}$ is multiples of $m$. This is actually the same thing if you think about what "multiples of $m$" means--it's just $mR$, a principal ideal of the ring $R$!
Also, we can express a **set** called congruent class $a+I:=\{  b \in R | a \equiv b ( \text{mod }I ) \}$.
- We say $a + I$ is a **coset** of the ideal $I$ in $R$.

## Quotient Ring
We collect all possibly **different congruent classes** in a new set which we call **quotient ring**:
$$
R / I := \{ a + I | a \in R \}.
$$
It means that quotient rings is "a ring of all congruent classes."
Note that the cardinal of the quotient ring is finite. Let's look at an example.
For ${I= <4> = 4\mathbb{Z}}$ and $R = \mathbb{Z}$, let's list all possible congruent classes:
$$
\begin{aligned}
 I & = \{ \dots, -8, -4, 0, 4, 8,\dots \}  & = 4 + I\\
 1 + I & = \{  \dots, -7, -3, 1, 5, 9,\dots \}  & = 5 + I\\
 2 + I  & = \{ \dots, -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, \dots \}  & = 6 + I\\
 3 + I  & = \{ \dots, -5, -1, 3, 7, 11, \dots \} & = 7 + I \\
 & \dots & \dots
\end{aligned}
$$
The manipulation looks just like increments of $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. In fact, they do have similarities which we describe as follows:
$$
\mathbb{Z} / n\mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}_{n}.
$$
Note: the symbol $\cong$ is called `\cong`.

# Field
## Basics
Definition of **Field**: A ring $R$ is a field if every nonzero element $a \in R$ has an inverse $a^{-1}$.

**Galois Field**: 就是一個有限自然數集合，而加減乘除都要做Modulo做運算；此外，除法需要視作乘法的反運算。
除法，如在$GF_{7}$除以4：就是乘以$4^{-1}$，which is 2 because $4\cdot 2=8\equiv 1( \text{mod }7 )$.

**Polynomial Ring** $F[x]$
The set of all polynomials whose **coefficients** are in fielid $F$ with usual additions and multipliations.
註：coefficients = 係數
零次多項式$f$: $\text{deg}(f) = 0$; 零多項式$g$: $\text{deg}(g)=-\infty$.

**Leading term**
The leading term of a polynomial $p(x)$, denoted as $LT(p(x))$, is the **monomial** $a_{m}x^{m}$ with the highest degree $m$ in $p(x)$.
