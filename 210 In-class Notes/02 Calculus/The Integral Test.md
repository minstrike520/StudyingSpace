Let $\{ a_{n} \}$ be a sequence of positive terms. Suppose that $a_{n} = f(n)$, where $f$ is a continuous, positive, decreasing function of $x$ for all $x \ge N$ ($N$ a positive integer). Then the series $\sum ^{\infty}_{n = N}a_{n}$ and the integral $\int ^{\infty}_{N}f(x) dx$ both converge or both diverge.
