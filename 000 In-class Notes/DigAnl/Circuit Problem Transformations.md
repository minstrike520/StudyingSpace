# Circuit Problem Transformations
We already have [[Basic Circuit Problem Solving Skills]], but the initial problem may be too complex to solve directly.

## Thevenin's Theorem
- General settings of both configurations and **observations**
- Simplifies a set of basic elements(resistors, voltage sources and current sources) to a circuit with ONLY one voltage source and one resistor chained.

## Norton's Theorem
- Similar to [[#Thevenin's Theorem]], Norton's theorem also simplifies a set of basic elements, but the different part is that it turns the set into a circuit with one **current source** and one resistor in parallel.
