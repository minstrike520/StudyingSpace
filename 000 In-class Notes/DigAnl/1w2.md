> How to build a proper hardware that serves as a function?

$$
f(x_{1}, x_{2}) = x_{1} + x_{2}
$$
$$
f(x_{3}) = \frac{x_{3}}{2}
$$

# Analog Signals and Digital Signals
Analog: "continuous"
Digital: "discrete"

Analog: Values must be *functions of time*.

$$
\mathbb{X} = \{ x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t), x_{3}(t), \dots \}
$$

Digital: Threshold, discretization and sampling
