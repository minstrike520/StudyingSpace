# What's the niche for Kamala Harris to win the presidential election?
## 1. Gender and race
In the US, women have been in serious state in participating politics, and also, there had never been a woman president, so if Harris will win the election, she will be the first woman president throughout the US history which will sign a significant milestone of woman suffrage. Also, as half African and half Southern Asian, Harris definitely have the right to speak for people of color in the US.

## 2. Economic Policies
Since the high house price has been an issue, Harris promises that first-time homebuyers will financially supported with $25K. Also, Harris proposed a policy that raises the federal minimum wage. Speak of immigrant issue, Kamala supports a border security bill which put 1500 more agents to help the folks, while Trump insisted the idea of mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.

## 3. Abortion
Harris supports abortion for fetus under 22 weeks, while Trump claims that the issue should be considered by the states, not the resident. According to a survey, more than 60 percent of people in the US agrees that abortion should be legal, so it will be an advantage for Harris. 

# If you were Trump, how would you make a comeback win the sway states?
If I were trump, I will pose a lot of tweet on Twitter saying that a lot of Harris's policy have their downside. And ask my supporter to retweet them, or even spread them on the other social media. At the same time, since Kamala Harris have no diplomatic experience, which can be a downside to be the US president who leads the greatest country in the world, I could stress this point during public speeches as tactics.
