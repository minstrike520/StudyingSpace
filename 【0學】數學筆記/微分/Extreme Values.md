> **Theorem**
> We know that $y = f(x)$ has extreme value at $x = a$, and if derivative of $f(x)$ exists, then $f'(a) = 0$.

- Thoughts
	- Put *"$y = f(x)$ has real value at $x = a$"* and *"$f(x)$ has derivative at $x = a$"* together shows that $f(x)$ is continuous at $x = a$.
	- Imagine a common polynomial function. Near its local highest area, there's a point that its slope is 0 (which indicates that its derivative value is 0). That's it! The derivative value at the continuous highest point must be 0.
